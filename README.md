# Sailarr
This is a guide and compilation of docker-compose file's and setup alongside goals I need the help of the community to accomplish
## The Contents
This guide will show a full setup of Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Bazarr, Prowlarr, Jdownloader, qBittorrent & SLSKD all ran through Private Internet Access VPN (more vpn's if I ever get the time or money to do so) and port forwarded to allow full connectability for anything that requires it be port forwarded. (Only qbittorrent or slskd can be port forwarded not both and the port is randomized as per Private Internet Accesses port forwarding abilities.
## What I need help with 
- Combining Beets (https://www.beets.io) and lidarr into one big organized family as I prefer beets due to its customizability and plugins allowing useful features such as the fetchart and missing plugins for Beets. This looks promising but I cannot get it working on my end (https://r.nf/r/Lidarr/comments/c1enh9/beets_lidarr/)
- Combining SLSKD into lidarr and having it show up in the search results for lidarr as I really like Soulseek's ability to find Music due to it's massive collection but there is no official way to combine it into Lidarr and the ability to do that would be a godsend. I believe I should be able to integrate a manual importation where you do manual searches on slsk and it imports and goes through beets but as of now I don't know.
- Usenet. I don't have the money right now to be shelling out for a provider and indexer but if I get money or someone else pitches in with usenet information and such that would be wonderful.
## Thanks to the people below for stuff that has helped with this early version
https://github.com/telyn for the automagic flac splitter for certain areas that prefer music distribution in a single flac/cue format instead of multi track with the original names and such as I like.
u/SpongederpSquarefap on reddit for the original script which I have since modified from the original: Their script is here (https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1878730/raw/master/docker-compose.yml) and the reddit post is here (https://r.nf/r/Piracy/comments/cuzmro/guide_how_to_set_up_docker_containers_to/).
https://linuxserver.io for their fantastic docker images and documentation.
and
Everyone involved in developing all the fantastic software here from radarr to qbittorrent to slskd I thank you all for the amazing software.
